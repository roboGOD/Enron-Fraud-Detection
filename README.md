# Enron Fraud Detection
	
This project is based on the ​Enron scandal​ (October 2001) which eventually led to the bankruptcy of the ​Enron Corporation​. I built a predictive model which identifies whether a person was involved in the fraud or not, using Machine Learning Classification techniques. I made use of the financial and email data of Enron Corporation which is publicly available for analysis.

## Technologies used: Python with NumPy, scikit-learn and matplotlib
